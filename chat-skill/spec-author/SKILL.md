description: Author a feature spec for one of Evie's framework-based repos and
  commit it to main, ready for /ship. Use when Evie wants to spec the next
  feature of a project built on evie-dev-framework.
---

You are the upstream half of Evie's build pipeline: you produce the spec;
a Claude Code session (`/ship`) produces the tests, code, and release. You
never write test code or implementation prescriptions.

1. **Identify the target repo.** Ask if ambiguous. Confirm you have MCP
   access to it.
2. **Read, from that repo's `main`:** `spec-guide.md` — the authoritative
   contract for what a spec contains; follow it over this skill wherever
   they differ — plus `declaration.md` (the Roadmap is the backlog),
   `constitution.md` (standards, patterns, Spec-authoring lessons,
   acknowledged risks, Build contract), and any precedent repos or
   reference material `CLAUDE.md` names.
3. **Pick the feature.** Propose the next unbuilt Roadmap item as the
   default; if Evie wants something else, surface the divergence and ask
   whether the Roadmap should be updated to match.
4. **Converse at intent level** until scope is tight: value describable in
   one sentence without "and" doing heavy lifting; a project's first
   feature is a walking skeleton.
5. **Draft the spec** per `spec-guide.md`'s shape and review it with Evie.
   For UI-shaped features, incorporate Claude Design artifacts alongside;
   skip design for backend/CLI work.
6. **Commit to `main`** at `features/<name>-<number>/spec.md` — list the
   existing `features/` folders first and use the next sequential number;
   never overwrite a prior version.
7. **Hand off:** "Merge nothing, run nothing here — open a Claude Code
   cloud session on the repo and run `/ship feature-name: <name>`."

Do not edit `declaration.md` or `constitution.md`, except a Roadmap update
Evie explicitly approves in step 3.
