# Evie Dev Framework

A template repository for building software with Claude Code. It encodes the part of building that the model can't derive — what to build, why, what "done" means, the standards, the risks knowingly accepted — and hands everything else to one command in one session.

## The workflow

1. **Author the spec upstream.** In a claude.ai chat with MCP access to the repo, talk through the next feature. The chat reads `declaration.md` and `constitution.md`, follows `spec-guide.md`, and commits `features/<name>-<number>/spec.md` to `main` — with Claude Design artifacts alongside when the feature is UI-shaped.
2. **Run `/ship` in a Claude Code cloud session.** It checks the spec against the project's accumulated judgment, asks everything unclear in one upfront batch, writes the acceptance tests, runs an independent clean-context adversarial gate, builds until every suite is green, and opens the PR.
3. **Approve the PR.** Your review is the one human gate mid-flow; merging acknowledges any carried findings listed in the PR body.
4. **The session watches the release.** After merge it follows the deploy through GitHub Actions and the target platform to a verified healthy release, fixes what breaks, then reports and ends.

## This repo is a template

Clone or fork it; the clone becomes the app you're building. Files that ship with placeholders: this `README.md` (replace with your app's), `CLAUDE.md` (project name, run/test/deploy sections), `declaration.md`, `constitution.md`'s `## Testing` section (populated on first `/ship`), and `features/` (empty; folders are created per feature). The template itself has no executable code; the quality gates in `constitution.md` apply to copied apps.

## Commands

| Command | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `/setup` | One-time fill of `CLAUDE.md` + `declaration.md` on a fresh clone |
| `/ship` | Everything between a committed spec and a verified deployment |
| `/upgrade` | Pull the latest framework files into this project |

Small changes that don't warrant a spec don't need a command — open a session and ask; the PR is the documentation.

## Where the judgment lives

- `declaration.md` — intent: what, why, for whom, out of scope, Platform, Shape, Roadmap.
- `constitution.md` — accumulated judgment: standards, principles, patterns, the build contract, spec-authoring lessons, quality gates, testing wiring, decision log, acknowledged risks.
- `spec-guide.md` — the contract the upstream chat follows when authoring a spec.
- `chat-skill/` — the canonical source of the claude.ai `spec-author` skill, a thin wrapper that fetches and follows `spec-guide.md` via MCP (uploaded once to claude.ai; not distributed by `/upgrade`).

See [`user-guide.md`](user-guide.md) for the full division of labor.
